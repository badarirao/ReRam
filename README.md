# ReRam
ReRam is a pyqt5 based gui program for measuring various resistive switching properties of your sample. It is designed to work with a Keithley 2450 or Keysight B2902B sourcemeter. It can also connect to an AFG1022 function generator to apply source pulse voltage. If you are interested in running the program, and need help, feel free to email me at badari.rao@gmail.com.

## Software capabilities
The software stores the data in txt format, and the user can add details of sample and measurement in comment section.
The measurement can be made in either 2-wire or 4-wire configuration.

Follwing measurement feauters are currently possible:
- IV loops
- Read resistance vs pulse voltage loops
- Switching resistance states for n times and measuring the resistance after each switch.
- Endurance/fatigue test
- Retention test
- Forming of the specimen

Following features are being planned for future release:
- Switching speed test
- Aging test
- Memristor study
- Temperature control and temperature dependence study
