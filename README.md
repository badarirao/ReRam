 This software is a work in progress.
 I have built this to test resistive switching samples using a Keithley 2450 sourcemeter
 Currently, the software can carrry out IV loop measurements, plot read resistance vs write voltage, and a custom switiching program.
 Future planned development are as follows:
  1) Integrate it with a function generator, so that pulses of definite width can be used, and will enable additional functions 
     such as testing resistance with varying pulse-width, endurance testing, retention testing, and so on.
  2) Integrate with a temperature stage, so that properties can be tested at different temperatures.
